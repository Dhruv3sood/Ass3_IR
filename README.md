Toolset Based on Amazon Dataset | Fine-tuning, Collaborative Filtering, CNNs
• Multimodal Retrieval: Fine-tuned a ResNet CNN for image feature extraction and utilized TF-IDF for text
processing, achieving a composite similarity score exceeding 90% in matching images with corresponding text.
• Recommendation System: Applied collaborative filtering techniques to analyze user interactions and preferences,
recommending relevant items with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.3 by matching users with similar histories.
• Review Summarization: Fine-tuned GPT-2 to summarize reviews, achieving a Rouge Score of 55%. This involved
building custom DataLoader classes and optimizing hyperparameters.
